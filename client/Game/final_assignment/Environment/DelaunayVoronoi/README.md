# C# Delaunay triangulation + Voronoi Diagram

A C# implementation of the [Bowyerâ€“Watson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowyer%E2%80%93Watson_algorithm).
The result is a [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) for a set of randomly generated points.
Following the Delaunay triangulation, the dual [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) is constructed.

A screenshot of the Delaunay triangulation and the Voronoi diagram for 5000 points.

## Why C#?

It just looks good. Also, blog posts listed below talking about procedural content and map generation caught my eye.
Since my intention is to port the algorithms to the [Unity game engine](https://unity3d.com/) for future projects, I decided to stick to C#, as it is Unity's scripting language of choice.
